Linking ambient pollution with risk of cancer

## What we want to test
1. Risk of getting lung/skin cancer based on fine particulate matter
2. Risk of cancer in male vs female
3. Risk of cancer in first/third world countries

# Risk of getting lung/skin cancer based on fine particulate matter

  We have started to see drastic changes to the air quality due to forest fires and other pollutants in the air. Due to these occurances we believe that evaluating the risk of lung cancer and melanoma compared to levels of particulate matter in the air would be an important question to answer. Our hypothesis is that higher levels of particulate matter will lead to greater risk of cancer, the risk of cancer will be the same across genders, more densely populated countries will have a greater risk of caner, and countreis sharing similar geographic locations will show similar risk of levels of cancer. 
  
  The beginning of our data search we looked at the levels of fine particulate matter and the risk of getting lung cancer and melanoma.  When creating these graphs we made bar charts to show the levels side by side for each country so we could easily compare the difference in levels for each country.  When looking at the levels of particle matter per country we found that countries in the same geographical location were mostly similar with the levels of concentration they had. When looking at the charts for risk of lung cancer and melanoma we found that geography did not play as big of a factor as some countries were higher than others in their region. 
  
  To draw our conclusion that higher levels of fine particulate matter lead to greater risks of getting lung cancer and melanoma we looked at eachg country individually for each graph to see if there was a pattern.  In the end we found that there was no direct correlation to indivudal countries specifically, for example Kuwait had the highest levels of particulate matter concentration but a lower risk of lung cancer and one of the lowest risks of melanoma.  The two countries where levels of particulate matter were high as well as the risk of getting lung cancer, were China and Germany.  The opposite effect took place when looking at Norway as they had low levels of particulate matter but were relativley high for the risk of getting lung cnacer and melanoma.  The biggest diference we saw was Australia and New Zealand having low levels of particulate matter, but had somewhat high levels of lung cancer and the two highest levels for the risk of getting melanoma.
  
  In the end we are unable to conclude that countries with a higher level of fine particulate matter have a higher risk of getting lung cancer or melanoma.  Other conclusions can be made about geographical locations having the same types of numbers, but numbers for indvidual countries do not direclty correlate to show higher levels mean higher risk.
